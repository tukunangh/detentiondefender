## Post Body (Organic/Value-First)

Been lurking here for a while. The detention pay horror stories are real — sat at the dock for 5 hours, claim denied because "documentation was insufficient."

Working on a simple app idea:
- **One tap** logs arrival (GPS timestamp + location verified)
- **Auto-prompts** at 2hr mark to photo the dock/BOL  
- **One tap** logs departure when you're done
- **Generates PDF** with everything: coordinates, timestamps, photos, total wait time, detention amount at your rate

The whole point: documentation so bulletproof brokers can't deny it.

Planning a free tier (3 claims/month) and Pro ($9.99/mo unlimited). One recovered detention claim (~$100-300) pays for a year of Pro.

**Honest question:** Would this actually help? Or is there something else that's the real blocker to getting detention paid?

## Comment Engagement Strategy

**If asked "why not just use [existing app]?":**
> Great question — most TMS/ELD apps do way more than this (and cost way more). Looking at this as a simple, single-purpose tool specifically for detention documentation. What app are you using now?

**If asked about pricing:**
> Trying to keep it dead simple: free tier for occasional use, $9.99/mo for heavy users. Feedback welcome — does that seem fair?

**If negative feedback:**
> Appreciate the honesty. What would actually help? Trying to learn before building the wrong thing.
