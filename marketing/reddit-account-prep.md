# Reddit Account Prep — DetentionDefender

## Account: tukunangh@gmail.com / H3ndr1k4g3ntX

## Target Subreddits
- **r/Truckers** (295k members) — Primary target
- **r/TruckingJobs** — Secondary
- **r/owneroperators** — If exists
- **r/FreightBrokers** — For insight, not posting

## Pre-Post Checklist

Before posting, verify:
- [ ] Account not banned from r/Truckers
- [ ] Has some karma (50+ preferred)
- [ ] Recent activity looks organic (not all promo)

## Warm-Up Strategy (If Needed)

If account needs warming for trucking subs:

**Day 1-2:** Observe r/Truckers
- Read top posts from past month
- Note common complaints, language, tone
- Identify detention-related threads

**Day 3-5:** Helpful comments
- Comment on 2-3 posts/day
- Topics: detention issues, broker complaints, documentation tips
- Be genuinely helpful, no product mention
- Build credibility as someone who "gets it"

**Day 6-7:** Strategic engagement
- Comment on detention threads specifically
- Share empathy, not solutions yet
- Prepare for product reveal

## Post Timing

Best times for r/Truckers (US truckers):
- Morning: 6-9 AM EST (before driving)
- Evening: 6-9 PM EST (after driving)
- Weekends: Higher engagement

Avoid: Middle of workday (truckers driving)

## Alternative: Paid Reddit Ads

If organic approach is blocked or slow:
- Reddit Ads targeting r/Truckers
- $25 budget
- Promoted post format (looks native)
- Link to landing page

This bypasses account karma requirements.
