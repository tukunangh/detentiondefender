## Channel 1: Reddit Ads ($25)

### Targeting
- **Subreddit:** r/Truckers (295k members), r/TruckingJobs
- **Audience:** 18-65, US, interested in trucking/logistics
- **Ad type:** Promoted post (looks native)

### Ad Copy Options

**Option A — Pain-first:**
> 🚛 Sat at the dock 5 hours. Got paid for zero.
> 
> Tired of losing detention pay to "documentation issues"? An app is coming that auto-logs GPS timestamps and generates bulletproof invoices.
>
> Get early access → [Link]

**Option B — Stat-first:**
> Truckers lose $11.5 billion/year to unpaid detention.
> 
> One app. One tap. Bulletproof documentation.
>
> Be first to know → [Link]

**Option C — Validation question:**
> Working on an app to auto-document detention time (GPS timestamps + photos → PDF invoice). Would this actually help you get paid?
>
> Feedback = early access → [Link]

### Reddit Organic Posts
- Post in r/Truckers as genuine question, not ad
- "Building a detention documentation app — would you use it?"
- Engage authentically in comments

---

## Channel 2: Facebook ($15)

### Target Groups
- Trucking Industry News (50k+)
- Owner Operator Trucking (100k+)
- Truckers Against Trafficking (160k+)
- OTR Truckers (varies)

### Ad Format
- Single image or short video
- Mobile-first (truckers scroll on phone at stops)

### Ad Copy

> **Waited 6 hours. Got paid for zero.**
> 
> Stop losing detention pay to "insufficient documentation."
> 
> We're building an app that auto-logs your arrival with GPS, reminds you to photo-document at 2 hours, and generates invoices brokers can't deny.
> 
> Join the waitlist → [Link]
>
> Free tier available. One recovered claim pays for a year of Pro.

### Facebook Organic
- Join 3-5 groups, observe conversations
- Post value-first (share detention tips), then mention app naturally
- DON'T spam — build credibility first

---

## Channel 3: TikTok ($10 optional)

### Approach
- Create 30-sec video explaining the problem
- Trucker TikTok is HUGE (search #truckerlife)
- Boost video with $10 if organic traction

### Video Script (30 sec)

> [POV: Sitting in truck cab]
> "Sat here for 6 hours. Submitted detention claim. Denied."
> 
> [Text overlay: "Documentation insufficient"]
> 
> "They wanted GPS proof. Timestamped photos. I had a napkin."
> 
> [Cut to app mockup]
> 
> "Building something so this never happens again. One tap = bulletproof documentation."
> 
> "Link in bio if you want early access."

## Emergency Pivots

2. Test "free" messaging more prominently
3. Try video instead of static ad
4. Ask in comments what would make them try it
