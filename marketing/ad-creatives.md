## Reddit Native Post Format

Reddit ads work best as native-looking posts:

```
Title: Built an app to stop losing detention pay. Would you actually use it?

Body:
Been lurking here for a while. The detention pay horror stories are real.

Working on an app that:
- One tap logs arrival (GPS timestamp, location)
- Auto-prompts you at 2hr mark for photos
- Generates PDF invoice with all the proof brokers need

Free tier: 3 claims/month
Pro: $9.99/mo unlimited

Would this actually help? Honest feedback = early access when we launch.

This format gets engagement AND conversions.
