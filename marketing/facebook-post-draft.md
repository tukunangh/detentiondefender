## Post (Organic/Value-First)

**Waited 6 hours at the dock. Got paid for zero.**

Detention claim denied — "insufficient documentation."

Sound familiar?

Working on an app that might help. Simple concept:
✅ Tap "arrived" → GPS logs exact location + timestamp
✅ App reminds you to photo document at 2hr mark
✅ Tap "leaving" → calculates total wait time
✅ Generates PDF invoice with all the proof brokers need

Free tier available. One recovered claim pays for a year of Pro.

Would this actually help you get paid? Or is there something else that's the real problem?

Feedback welcome. Early signup if interested: [link]

## Shorter Version (For Groups with Link Restrictions)

**Detention claims getting denied?**

Building an app that auto-documents arrival/departure with GPS timestamps + photos → generates bulletproof invoice PDFs.

Would this help? What's actually blocking you from getting paid?
